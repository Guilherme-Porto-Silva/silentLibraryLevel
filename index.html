                        Also known as "The Silent Library", level -250 is the 251th level under <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tutorial Zone</a>, and takes the apearence of infinitely streaching halls with high bookshelfs for its most part. Those halls have bege floors with black patters, spruce-made roof with evenly-spaced and shield-shaped lamps atached to it, reliasing an orange-yellow glow, and a medium temperature of 293Â° in the absolute scale. It is aways clean no matter where you go, since the same automatic clean seen in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">level 5</a> is also present here, with the diference of heppening every five minutes insted of any time a surface gets dirty.

                        The bookshelfs are made out of oak wood and split into categorys, like comedy and terror, though the infinity of the level leads to there being infinite sections for each theme. Also, two shelfs might have the same theme though being right next to each other, so... Their books can also be written in languages humanity might never get to translate, assumed to belong to other universes from wich it is possible to no-clip into the Backrooms, like the one the Lost Hall Society came from. None of them spread paphogens from other dimentions, as the automatic clean every five minutes also effects living beings provided they have less than two cells.

                        All vibrations provoked in The Silent Library - and in the rooms dedicated to it at <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Backrooms Museum</a> - fix themselves in a metter of nanoseconds, turnig sound into an impossible phenomenon. This level effect, called "Vibraphobia", is responsible for the level to be ABSOLUTELY silent, thus giving it its popular name. To some, this is a huge atractor factor to the level, specialy combined to the extented amount of knolege residing in its infinite pappers, to others, its the reason why level -250 is an extreamely easy place for you to become an <a href="https://backrooms-freewriting.fandom.com/wiki/Insanities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entity 15</a>.

                        The Comfortable Rooms
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Comfortable Rooms are cubes with four doors, one at each side, soft and new sofas, a table at the very middle with four glass-made squares and dark oak tables scatered around, on wich are found sugar and cookie pots, cafeterias and coolers with <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almond water</a>. Soft and cute red carpets cover their floors, making it a not bad idea to sit or lie on them insted of the sofas. Those tables at the very middle generate papper-made creations every time a person walks into the Comfortable Room they are in, wich are clearly based on that person, possibly being the one they most like, the one they were willing to find or one that ansers a question that has been noguing their haed in the close past.

                    <p>
                        Once, a large group of people entered a Comfortable Room at once with the goal of testing its middle table's capabilitys. The object generated so many papper creations that the entire room was taken over by papper and latter capes, deformating eachother by smashing against walls and roof. Being instantanius the generation process, it is obvius that few of those testers survived, being there where the most interesting part of this history begings: while reading paranormal-themed books, other level visitors, among wich many had no idea of the testing event, started documenting sightings of ghost-like humanoids that mach to the aperences of those dead testers, but never of those few that survived and came to die in other levels. Not all ghostly humanoids seen by paranormal-themed book readers in level -250 participated to that test, but none of them has higher odds of having died in other levels, leaving the thought that those who die here do never leave. Those ghosts are barely seen, apearing for one or two seconds when the reader lifts their look.

                        The ghosts might be considered entitys, or as just dead people, or they might be alucinations, though the last option would aply the level makes its alive visitors see those who have died in it even if they did not know they existed. Mimic entitys is aways an explanation we cannot descart without proper evidence. <a href="https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Facelings#:~:text=Facelings%20are%20one%20of%20the,inhabit%20most%20of%20its%20levels.&text=The%20behavior%20of%20a%20Faceling,wanderers%20while%20others%20are%20passive." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facelings</a> can be found as well, usually reading. They only get agressive if interupted, with the adults showing regular reactions when that is done calmly and only once.

The Cultureless are very similar to humans, the only diference being their dark blue - almost black - eyes. They are aways dressed like ripsters or funkers, usually vibrant colored clothes, and it is very comun for them to be wearing hats, wich tend to be red or blue. The Vibraphobia effect is turned off during the Interuption event, wich is horroble, as the Cultureless carry big radio things around the entire level and keep dancing around the humans and facelings with them turned on. Sad machines blast music at extreamely lound volumes, turning killing a Cultureless a hard mission for non-deaf people, who fell like they are about to lose sad caracteristic, and wish to cover their ears all the time the entitys are nearby. The Cultureless actively seek out to bother readers, many times engaging fights agaist the facelings. They might also spawn in with sprays and keep spraying all surfaces around the level, this mess disapears upon the end of the event, as well as any Cultureless, dead or alive.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Killing a faceling or depriving a book sends to <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">level !</a>

                <li>
                    Committing while holding a book that mentions war sends you to war-themed levels, the heavier the war in the book, the more dangerous the level you are sent to
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kissing any book that talks about hotels has 50% chance to send you to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">level 5</a> and 50% to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">level 327</a>

                <li>
                    Dancing to the music a Cultureless is blasting nearby triggers the formation of a group of Cultureless and facelings around. They judge if you are a good or a bad dancer, with the result of sad judge determinating wich sublevel of <a href="https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game</a> you go to: good dancers are teleported to You Win, bad dancers are teleported to Game Over.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Depriving, expecifically, a book that talks about the Backrooms sends to the Frontrooms, wich is interesting because you can find books talking about the Frontrooms in level -250, and those who take them to the Frontrooms and deprive them there are sent to one of the trhee first Backrooms levels
